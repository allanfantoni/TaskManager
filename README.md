### Requirements

1. **Layered Architecture** - As discussed in class, it's a good practice to divide our application into layers.
Therefore, your project should include:

   - Business rules layer
   
2. **Suggested data and fields** - A task should have the following fields:
   - A unique ID to identify each task
   - A name
   - A description of what the task is about
   - A priority (***You can define it as high, medium, or low, for example***)
   - A due date for the task to be completed
   - A status (***You can define three statuses: completed, in progress, and pending, for example***)
   
3. **Required endpoints**
   - It should be possible to create a task
   - It should be possible to view all created tasks
   - It should be possible to view a task by searching for its ID
   - It should be possible to edit a task’s information
   - It should be possible to delete a task
   
Remember to return the appropriate HTTP status codes for each operation. 😉
